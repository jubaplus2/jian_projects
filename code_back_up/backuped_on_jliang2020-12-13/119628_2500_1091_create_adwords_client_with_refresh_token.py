"""Initializes an AdWordsClient without using yaml-cached credentials.

While our LoadFromStorage method provides a useful shortcut to instantiate a
client if you regularly use just one set of credentials, production applications
may need to swap out users. This example shows you how to create an OAuth2
client and an AdWordsClient without relying on a yaml file.
